Third-Party APIs: Task Board

Title: task-board-module-5

Description:
In this challenge, I've developed a JavaScript file utilizing jQuery, jQuery UI, and Bootstrap UI to create a dynamic to-do list. This application allows users to add tasks and manage their to-dos efficiently. Here are the key features:

Overdue Warning: When the due date of a task has passed, the task card turns red to indicate it's overdue.
Due Today Alert: If the task's due date is today, the card turns yellow to alert the user.
Future Due Date: Cards remain in their natural state if the due date is in the future.
Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Users can drag cards to the 'done' list, which resets the card to its natural color and state.
Persistent Data: All tasks are deletable, and even if you refresh the page or revisit the app later, your to-dos will still be there for updating.
How to Run:
Add a Task:

Click on the "Add Task" button.
Fill out the form with the task details.
Click "Add Task" to add your task.
Your task will automatically appear in the "to-do" section.

Manage Tasks:

As you complete tasks, drag and drop them into the "In Process" or "Done" sections of the app.
This rephrased version maintains the original meaning and provides a clear and concise description of the application and its functionality.
